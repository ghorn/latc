Synopsis:           Generalized interface for numerical linear algebra

Description: { LATC provides a common interface for writing numerical
  code, with a strong emphasis on linear algebra.  Many different
  backends can be used with this interface; the current version
  supports HMatrix (BLAS/LAPACK), Repa, naive lists, vectors, IntMaps
  and more.

  It uses GHC-specific features like @ConstraintKinds@ and
  @TypeFamilies@ to propagate type constraints for different backends
  to user code; the advantage is that you should be able to run the
  same piece of code using any backend you like, and if you've written
  something that a particular backend can't support, the type
  constraints will tell you what's wrong (rather than GHC requiring
  you to go back through all your code and add a bunch of constraints
  so you can use HMatrix, for example)
}
